# GAME RULES:

- The game has 2 players, playing in rounds but this game has 2 dices.

- In each turn, a player rolls the two dices as many times as he whishes. The summation of the two dices get added to his ROUND score.

- BUT, if the player rolls a 1 in both of the dices simultaneously, all his ROUND score gets lost. After that, it's the next player's turn.

- The player can choose to 'Hold', which means that his ROUND score gets added to his GLOBAL score. After that, it's the next player's turn.

- Before starting the game, a winning point must have to be chosen.

- The first player to reach specified winning points on GLOBAL score wins the game.
